## FAQ

### How is this different than getting reviews using [app-store-scraper](https://github.com/facundoolano/app-store-scraper)?

That Node.js module uses a separate API and can get up to 500 reviews maximum. This module allows getting _all_ reviews by using a separate API and technique.

At a high level this is a port of the [python app-store-scraper](https://github.com/cowboy-bebug/app-store-scraper). I implemented that technique and approach here for this Node.js module.

This module [does what SerpApi sells](https://serpapi.com/blog/web-scraping-apple-app-store-product-info-and-reviews-with-nodejs/) but this is free.

### Why is the review count different than what is seen on the landing page?

The review count seen on the landing page differs from the actual number of reviews fetched. This is because only some users who rated the app also leave reviews.

### Why do I get more reviews returned than what is supplied to the `numberOfReviews` param?

The maximum number of reviews fetched per request is 20. To minimise the number of calls, the limit of 20 is hardcoded. It is possible to get more results than what is passed to `numberOfReviews`.
